v1.3.0 - in progress.. 
	I'm currently working on this one... I've merged in the changes I've made section-by-section
	and tagged it at each stage, so it's not all checked in as one massive change list! 

	I run my own IM servers, so I can do things such as kicking my phone off the server by forcibly closing the connection
	As a result, I've discovered that the "Auto-Reconnect" options aren't working very gracefully
	I have implemented some new logic for handling the automatic reconnection of the socket, which appears to be working
	quite nicely. Once I'm happy it's stable and doesn't adversely affect anything, I'll merge and commit that change as 1.3.0
	
	It's probably a safe bet to do some translating if you get half a chance, as I doubt I'll add any new translations in 1.3.0
	
	Changes:
	Added Log class to centralise calls to System.out etc
	Changed XmppPinger class to use Constants to determine whether to ping every 30 seconds or 5 minutes (DEBUG related)
	New logic in Jxa to handle disconnections more gracefully. If the server drops the connection, but the underlying network
	stays up, this is now handled gracefully. If the network (Wifi etc) disconnects, this still resorts to a Symbian OS error on S60
	A couple of code optimisations (removing unused variables etc)
	
	
v1.2.0 - Updated release by Mark

	** Application Data NOT backwards compatible with v1.1.0!!!
	Either uninstall v1.1.0 then install v1.2.0 or answer "No" if 
	your phone prompts you to keep the existing application data

	* New translations required in this version

	* New Keepalive Option
	  - Added XmppPinger class which sends an IQ PING packet (XMPP standard) every 5 minutes to the server, to keep the connection alive.
	
	Refactor of TextBoxItem to allow optional captions - this allows us to hide the message above the create new message dialog

	Added Constants class to be used later

	Made GUIStore constructor private so nothing can instantiate it
	
	Added a couple of utility methods to AppStore for later usage
	Added "isS40" and "isS60" methods to AppStore
	
	Used isS40 and isS60 methods in ContactListUI to determine whether to display "minimise" or "status" button
	
	Added mute/unmute and global prefs menu links	
	
	Added Global Preferences for:
	Sounds On/Off (including mute/unmute support) - global override
	Display Name (default picked up for new profiles)
	Volume (default picked up for new profiles)
	Vibrate Alert (default picked up for new profiles)
	Vibration Time (default picked up for new profiles)

	Removed Class NetworkDispatcher from the source tree

	Added MIMConstants interface with default values defined as constants

	Fixed a potential (it happened once or twice) NPE in processNewMessage() on UserList class 

	Fixed a couple of UI consistency issues with capitalisation and colon usage in the English resources file
	Externalised as many strings as I can find on the UI to ease future translations

	According to Nokia Style Guidelines:
	Commands can be grouped to postive (OK, ITEM, SCREEN, HELP) and negative (BACK, CANCEL, EXIT, STOP).
	Nokia user interface guidelines and style positions negative operations like backward navigation to right softkey. 
	Positive operations like forward navigation is in left or middle softkeys.
	Double-checking that this is obeyed, MicroEmulator puts the text editing dialog buttons the opposite way of course!! 

v1.1.0 - Updated release by Mark

	** Application Data NOT backwards compatible with v1.0.0!!!
	Either uninstall v1.0.0 then install v1.1.0 or answer "No" if 
	your phone prompts you to keep the existing application data

	New Functionality
		
		Customisable "Resource" property for XMPP connection
		
		Added "Display Name" to connection profile
		
		Added vibrate function for supported handsets (most)
		
		Minimise Support - allows running in the background
		
		Added user-friendly titles to all screens
			- Chat with <Remote User Display Name> for ChatUI
			- Profile Name for ContactListUI, rather than JID
		
		Changed right and left click buttons in Contact List and ChatUI
		
		Added menu with disconnect and quit options, and put "minimise" 
		as right click option rather than disconnect
		
		Workaround: Added keypress options for 3,6,9 to increase volume 
		and vibrate times as rightclick isn't working. 

		Restricted port number dialog entry to numbers only

	Known Issues
		
		Need to add a method "supportsBackgroundRunning()" which returns
		true if the phone supports minimise/background running of J2ME
		applications, and false otherwise. This can then be used to
		determine whether minimise or another function is assigned
		to the right screen key on the UI
		
		Still having connection timeout problems (intermittently)

v1.0.0 - Initial Release uploaded to googlecode by chunlinyao
	
	Known Issues
		
		A few missing titles, and some UI Strings are hardcoded
		
		On S60, right joypad does not increase volume or vibrate time
		on the slider control, but left click DOES decrease it!
		
		When contacts go offline, their status icon changes to red
		(busy), rather than the grey cross (offline). This means it's
		hard to distinguish if someone has gone to DND or offline
		
		"Error message" dialogue doesn't always dissappear properly
