This package contains the XML-Reader and XML-Writer Class, the JXA API Class to communicate with a jabber server and the XmppListener Interface to get events.
</p>
<p>
With {@link net.sourceforge.jxa.Jxa} (J2ME XMPP API) you can create an object for every session with a jabber
server. On creation it will login with the given data to a given jabber host.
You can specify the hostname/port of a jabber server, your username/password,
the used resource and the priority of the connecting resource.
</p>
<p>
When the object is created, you can use its public methods to get the roster,
set your status, send a message, even do various subscription tasks. All
events from the server to your client will be catched and you only have
to implement the interface methodes of XmppListener and use the methode
{@link net.sourceforge.jxa.Jxa#addListener(XmppListener xl)} to add an event listener.
</p>
<p>
The main application/midlet that uses this API can be found in {@link jxac}
