Allow show/hide of "Transports" on the buddy list

Allow switch to show-hide status on the buddy list

Lock screen for S40 - a la JIMM IM

Implement "show status" and "get info" functions in contact list

Allow "popup" (bring to front) when minimised upon new message and/or errors (options required for these functions)

Check smilies, not sure they're actually implemented despite the being a menu option for them?

Options for:
Confirm before send or "instant send" of new messages

Can we map the volume up and down keys? Keycodes don't appear to be passed through

Limit text input fields to sensible lengths...

Add a new account "wizard" setup which takes:
Googlemail Address & Password

and sets up the account for you as follows:
Profile Name: Google
Username    : lowercase email address
Server      : talk.google.com
SSL enabled, Google account = true

We could perhaps set this to run at startup if no other accounts exist, and allow the user to exit out to the main menu screen

So something like:

Start > if (noAccounts()) > "Would you like to setup a new account for GoogleTalk now?" > Yes > Into Wizard
       --> else there are > Show normal menu homescreen or auto-connect                  > No > Drop to homescreen
